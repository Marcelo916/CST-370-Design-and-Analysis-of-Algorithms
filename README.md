# CST 370 – Design and Analysis of Algorithms

This repository contains two C++ coding assignments completed for the CST 370 course at CSU Monterey Bay. 
The assignments demonstrate algorithmic problem-solving techniques focused on dynamic programming and graph algorithms.

## Projects

### 1. Coin Collection Problem (Dynamic Programming)
- Implements a dynamic programming solution to collect the maximum number of coins on an `n x m` board.
- Finds both the maximum number of coins and the path taken through the board.

### 2. Floyd’s Algorithm (Graph Algorithms)
- Implements Floyd's Algorithm to compute the all-pairs shortest paths in a weighted directed graph.
- Handles infinite distances (represented as `-1`) and outputs the final shortest-path matrix.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph Theory (Floyd-Warshall Algorithm)**
